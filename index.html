        <h2>Why should you learn about grass?</h2>
        
        <p>Did you know that grass makes up 99.9% of life on earth? currently grass is the most important life-form know to humans. It is theorized that grass holds the secrets to unlocking lightspeed travel. If you aren't yet convinced to give up everything you know to follow the way of grass, consider this: governments around the world are currently abandoning their current systems to adopt the higher order psuedo-anarchical ways of grass. </p>

        <h2>Types of Grass:</h2>
        <br />

        <h3>Green Grass</h3>
        <img src="./HTML_Recap_Assets/Green_grass.jpg" alt="Green Grass" width="300" height="300" />
        <p>this is the most common form of grass. it's attributes include being green, making you feel connected to nature, and one in every billion will make you float upon contact.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3>Blue Grass</h3>
        <img src="./HTML_Recap_Assets/Blue_grass.jpg" alt="Foggy Mountain Boys" width="300" height="300" />
        <p>Mostly found in Kentucky, blue grass is the most aversive form of grass as people attempt to avoid it at all costs after first contact (accept for a small <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/" target="_blank">subset of people</a> we won't talk about on this page.)
        </p>

        <h3>Orange Grass</h3>
        <img src="./HTML_Recap_Assets/Orange_grass.jpg" alt="Orange grass" width="300" height="300" />
        <p>Orange grass also known as light red grass, is the most sacred form of grass known to man. However one of the most well kept secrets that top government officials have tried to do everything in their power to keep, is that orange grass is just yellow grass with red paint.
        </p>

        <h3>Black and White Grass</h3>
        <img src="./HTML_Recap_Assets/Black&White_grass.jpg" alt="Black and White Grass" width="300" height="300">
        <p>Finally We have black and White grass. this is rarest form of grass known to humanity and is known to bring enlightenment upon anyone that comes in contact with it. Sadly humans can no longer achieve enlightenment as black and white grass went exctinct in 1861 along with the birth of colored photography.</p>
